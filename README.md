# LayerLens

Generate dependency diagram in every folder of your Dart or Flutter
source code as [Mermaid `flowchart`](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) documents.

## Configure layerlens

1. Run `dart pub global activate layerlens`

2. Verify you can run `layerlens`. If you get `command not found`, make sure
your path [contains pub cache](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#running-a-script-from-your-path).

3. To see the diagrams in your IDE:

- **VSCode**: install `Markdown Preview Mermaid Support` extension

- **Android Studio**: enable the "Mermaid" extension in the
[Markdown language settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown-reference.html)

## Generate diagrams

1. Run `layerlens <your package root>`

2. Find the generated file DEPENDENCIES.md in each source folder, where
libraries or folders depend on each other.

3. In VSCode, right click DEPENDENCIES.md and select 'Open Preview'

## CI: re-generate on every GitHub push

1. Add a `dev_dependency` to https://pub.dev/packages/layerlens
2. Copy the content of [run-layerlens.yaml](https://github.com/polina-c/layerlens/blob/main/.github/workflows/run-layerlens.yaml)
to `.github/workflows`.

## Alert on circular references

You may want to avoid circular references, because without circles:
1. Code is easier to maintain
2. Chance of memory leaks is smaller
3. Treeshaking (i.e. not includine non-used code into build) is more efficient
4. Incremental build is faster

LayerLens marks inverted dependencies (dependencies that create circles) with '!'.

If, in addition, you want presubmit alerting for circular references,
upvote [the issue](https://github.com/polina-c/layerlens/issues/4)
and explain your use case.

## Supported languages

While layerlens concepts are language agnostic, for now only `dart` is supported.
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/polina-c/layerlens/issues/new), if you want other language to be added.
